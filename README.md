## A simple tutorial on convolution network in Python

It has a single-sample-based stochastic gradient descent algorithm, that uses a convolution layer, a perceptron layer (fully connection layer), and a softmax output layer.  

The convolution layer uses 4-level for-loop for convolution and gradients computations. It can be further optimized, but probably not necessary as a tutorial.
